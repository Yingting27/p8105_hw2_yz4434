# Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

- Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "professor_trash_wheel"
  )
prof_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(prof_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

- Gwynnda Trash Wheel

``` r
gwy_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Gwynnda_trash_wheel"
  )
gwy_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(gwy_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

## Merging

``` r
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

- Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021

``` r
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```

- Descriptions: According to the results of combine sheet, we can see
  that there are **845 rows**, with **15 columns** in total. The key
  variables include **trash_wheel_types, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
  homes_powered**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
  Trash Wheel is **216.26**. The total number of cigarette butts
  collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **1.63^{4}**

# Question 3

## Import dataset

``` r
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(current_age < age_at_onset & age_at_onset != ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.

At first, I delete the first row as this is label but not data, which is
not contained variable names for each column, using **skip function**.
Then, I omit the data of those participants who didn’t meet the
inclusion criteria (the data of current ages are larger than the data of
age at onset and those who don’t develop MCI), since the study need to
follow up participants and to see the situation that thy developed
disease, using **filter function to keep data that current_age \<
age_at_onset and have data with age at onset**. Next, since the original
data used numeric data, including 0 and 1 to mention sex and APOE4, I
regard 1 as male, 0 as female, and 1 as APOE4 carrier with 0 as APOE4
non-carrier,using **mutate and case_match functions**. After that, there
are **93** observations in the merged dataset. The key variables are
**id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4, age_at_onset**.

- How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
  MCI?

the number of original data

``` r
total_baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter (current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

There are 479 participants that were recruited, and 93 of these develop
MCI.

- What is the average baseline age?

``` r
baseline_df$age_at_onset = as.numeric(baseline_df$current_age)
```

The average baseline age is 65.5419355. The proportion of women in the
study are APOE4 carriers

- What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

``` r
prop_women = sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female" & total_baseline_df$apoe4 == "APOE4_carrier") / sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female")
```

The proportion of 0.3 women in the study are APOE4 carriers

# Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of mci_amyloid

``` r
amyloid_df =
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
    pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "time_values",
    names_prefix = "time_"
  ) |> 
  mutate(time = replace(time, time == "baseline", "0")
)
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Comment on the steps on the import process and the features of the
  dataset

Firstly, I skip the first row as this line is not the titles of each
columns, which is just a label that is not useful in R studio after
importing, using **skip function**. Secondly, I use **pivot function**
to make wide format to be long format, which is more convinent to read
and compare data. Thirdly, I change the time descriptions by using
numeric way, like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, by using **mutate and replace
function**. After doing that, there are **2435** observations in the
merged dataset. The key variables are **study_id, time, time_values**.
