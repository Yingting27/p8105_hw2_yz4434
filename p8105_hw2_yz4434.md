## Question 2

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Mr_trash_wheel"
  )
mr_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(mr_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

# Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

- Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "professor_trash_wheel"
  )
prof_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(prof_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

- Gwynnda Trash Wheel

``` r
gwy_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Gwynnda_trash_wheel"
  )
gwy_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(gwy_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

## Merging

``` r
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

- Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021

``` r
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```

- Descriptions: According to the results of combine sheet, we can see
  that there are **845 rows**, with **15 columns** in total. The key
  variables include **trash_wheel_types, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
  homes_powered**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
  Trash Wheel is **216.26**. The total number of cigarette butts
  collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **1.63^{4}**
