## Question 2

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Mr_trash_wheel"
  )
mr_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(mr_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

# Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

- Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "professor_trash_wheel"
  )
prof_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(prof_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

- Gwynnda Trash Wheel

``` r
gwy_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Gwynnda_trash_wheel"
  )
gwy_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(gwy_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

## Merging

``` r
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

- Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021

``` r
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```

- Descriptions: According to the results of combine sheet, we can see
  that there are **845 rows**, with **15 columns** in total. The key
  variables include **trash_wheel_types, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
  homes_powered**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
  Trash Wheel is **216.26**. The total number of cigarette butts
  collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **1.63^{4}**

## Question 3

# Import dataset

``` r
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(age_at_onset != ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset. How many participants were recruited, and of these how
  many develop MCI? What is the average baseline age? What proportion of
  women in the study are APOE4 carriers?
