# Problem 1

We clean the 538 `pols` data, which provides information on the number
of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given
time. There are some values for which `prez_gop` is `2` – these are
months in which Ford became President following Nixon’s resignation. In
the new `president` variable created as part of our data cleaning, we
code these as `gop` (same as values when `prez_gop` is `1`).

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols = 
  read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

We also clean the 538 `snp` data, which contains information related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(
    "data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_num)`

Finally, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with
the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(month_abb)`

Now we merge the three datasets!

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

``` r
str(data_538)
```

    ## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
    ##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
    ##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
    ##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
    ##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
    ##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
    ##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
    ##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has 822 observations
and 11 variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution
(democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year
from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting president
was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787 observations and 3
variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment` data has
816 observations and 3 variables ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In
Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the
**average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average unemployment rate
over the same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

## Merging

``` r
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

- Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021

``` r
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```

- Descriptions: According to the results of combine sheet, we can see
  that there are **845 rows**, with **15 columns** in total. The key
  variables include **trash_wheel_types, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
  homes_powered**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
  Trash Wheel is **216.26**. The total number of cigarette butts
  collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **1.63^{4}**

# Question 3

## Import dataset

``` r
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter (current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset.

At first, I delete the first row as this is label but not data, which is
not contained variable names for each column, using **skip function**.
Then, I omit the data of those participants who didn’t meet the
inclusion criteria (the data of current ages are larger than the data of
age at onset and those who don’t develop MCI), since the study need to
follow up participants and to see the situation that thy developed
disease, using **filter function to keep data that current_age \<
age_at_onset and have data with age at onset**. Next, since the original
data used numeric data, including 0 and 1 to mention sex and APOE4, I
regard 1 as male, 0 as female, and 1 as APOE4 carrier with 0 as APOE4
non-carrier,using **mutate and case_match functions**. After that, there
are **479** observations in the merged dataset. The key variables are
**id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4, age_at_onset**.

- How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
  MCI?

``` r
baseline_2 = filter(baseline_df, age_at_onset != ".")
```

There are **479** participants that were recruited, and **93** of these
develop MCI.

- What is the average baseline age?

``` r
baseline_df$age_at_onset = as.numeric(baseline_df$current_age)
```

The average baseline age is **65.0286013**. The proportion of women in
the study are APOE4 carriers

- What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

``` r
prop_women = sum(baseline_df$sex == "female" & baseline_df$apoe4 == "APOE4_carrier") / sum(baseline_df$sex == "female")
```

The proportion of **0.3** women in the study are APOE4 carriers

# Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of mci_amyloid

``` r
amyloid_df =
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
    pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8,
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "time_values",
    names_prefix = "time_"
  ) |> 
  rename(id = study_id) |> 
  mutate(time = replace(time, time == "baseline", "0")
)
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

- Comment on the steps on the import process and the features of the
  dataset

Firstly, I skip the first row as this line is not the titles of each
columns, which is just a label that is not useful in R studio after
importing, using **skip function**. Secondly, I use **pivot function**
to make wide format to be long format, which is more convenient to read
and compare data. Thirdly, I change the time descriptions by using
numeric way, like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, by using **mutate and replace
function**. After doing that, there are **2435** observations in the
merged dataset. The key variables are **id, time, time_values**.

# Combine datasets

- Combine the demographic and biomarker datasets so that only
  participants who appear in both datasets are retained, and briefly
  describe the resulting dataset

``` r
mci_combine = 
  inner_join(baseline_df, amyloid_df, by = "id") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

There are **2355** observations in the merged file, with important
variables including **id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4,
age_at_onset, time, time_values**.

- Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
  datasets, and comment on your findings.

``` r
mci_difference1 = anti_join(amyloid_df, baseline_df, by = "id")
mci_difference2 = anti_join(baseline_df, amyloid_df, by = "id")
```

There are **80** observations in amyloid datasets, with **8**
observations in baseline datasets.

- Export the result as a CSV to your data directory.

``` r
write.csv(mci_combine, "data/mci_combine.csv")
```
