# Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

- Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "professor_trash_wheel"
  )
prof_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(prof_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

- Gwynnda Trash Wheel

``` r
gwy_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Gwynnda_trash_wheel"
  )
gwy_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(gwy_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

## Merging

``` r
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

- Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021

``` r
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```

- Descriptions: According to the results of combine sheet, we can see
  that there are **845 rows**, with **15 columns** in total. The key
  variables include **trash_wheel_types, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls,
  homes_powered**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor
  Trash Wheel is **216.26**. The total number of cigarette butts
  collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **1.63^{4}**

# Question 3

## Import dataset

``` r
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(current_age < age_at_onset & age_at_onset != ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

- Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of
  the dataset According to the important process, we can see that we
  filter all information that meet this study inclusion criteria.
  Firstly, we delete the age onset data which is larger than current
  because current age would not be large than age at onset since this
  study need those participants who get disease after joining the study.
  Secondly, when we omit the missing data with only showing data of , we
  filter those participants who lost follow-up during the study. These
  steps are important, because

- How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
  MCI?

the number of original data

``` r
total_baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter (current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".") |>

    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )

    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )

There are 479 participants that were recruited, and 93 of these develop
MCI.

- What is the average baseline age?

``` r
baseline_df$age_at_onset = as.numeric(baseline_df$current_age)
```

The average baseline age is 65.5419355. The proportion of women in the
study are APOE4 carriers

- What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

``` r
prop_women = sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female" & total_baseline_df$apoe4 == "APOE4_carrier") / sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female")
```

The proportion of 0.3 women in the study are APOE4 carriers
