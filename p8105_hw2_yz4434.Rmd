## Question 2
```{r}
mr_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N586") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Mr_trash_wheel"
  )
mr_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(mr_trash_wheel_df$year)
```

# Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda

* Professor Trash Wheel

```{r}
prof_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "professor_trash_wheel"
  )
prof_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(prof_trash_wheel_df$year)
```


* Gwynnda Trash Wheel

```{r}
gwy_trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309_Trash_Wheel_Collection_Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:L157") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    homes_powered = weight_tons*500/30,
    trash_wheel_types = "Gwynnda_trash_wheel"
  )
gwy_trash_wheel_df$year = as.character(gwy_trash_wheel_df$year)
```


## Merging

```{r}
combine_sheet_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,prof_trash_wheel_df,gwy_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel_types)
```

* Calculate the total number of cigarette butts in 07/2021
```{r}
total_cigarettes = filter(gwy_trash_wheel_df, year == "2021", month == "July")
```


* Descriptions:
According to the results of combine sheet, we can see that there are **`r nrow(combine_sheet_df)` rows**, with **`r ncol(combine_sheet_df)` columns** in total. The key variables include **`r names(combine_sheet_df)`**. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is **`r sum(prof_trash_wheel_df$weight_tons)`**. The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is **`r sum(total_cigarettes$cigarette_butts)`**

# Question 3

## Import dataset
```{r}
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(age_at_onset != ".") |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```

* Discuss important steps in the import process and relevant features of the dataset.

* How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop MCI? 

the number of original data
```{r}
total_baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
    mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      0 ~ "female"
      )
) |> 
    mutate(
    apoe4 = case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "APOE4_carrier",
        0 ~ "APOE4_non_carrier"
      )
)
```
There are `r nrow(total_baseline_df)` participants that were recruited, and `r nrow(baseline_df)` of these develop MCI.

* What is the average baseline age? 
```{r}
baseline_df$age_at_onset = as.numeric(baseline_df$age_at_onset)
```

The average baseline age is `r mean(baseline_df$age_at_onset)`. The proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers

* What proportion of women in the study are APOE4 carriers?
```{r}
prop_women = sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female" & total_baseline_df$apoe4 == "APOE4_carrier") / sum(total_baseline_df$sex == "female")
```

The proportion of `r prop_women` women in the study are APOE4 carriers


# Import the dataset of longitudinally

```{r}
amyloid_df =
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip =1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
